# Create-react-secure-script
whenever i create a new react project useing npx create-react-app, i always had 8 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 6 high). To fix that i had to paste an override code inside package.json, delete node_modules, package-lock.jason, and run npm install. This script does all that for me.
